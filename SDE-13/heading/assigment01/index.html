     <h2><center><i>Raghuram Rajan wants central banks to focus only on inflation control to do an effective jobx</i></center></h2>
     <p> <center>Rising inflation globally has brought the role of <u> central banks </u>under sharp scrutiny with many experts pointing <br> to their
    failure in reading the exact nature of price pressures last year.Former <b> RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan,</b> in an interview to <br> Bloomberg, said that the central banks would do a far more
    effective job if they focus only on controlling inflation.He said issues like climate change job creation, though peripheral <br> to the central bank mandate, can better be dealt with
direct policy making.</center></p>
